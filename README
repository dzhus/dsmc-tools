This package provides CLI to dsmc library to perform rarefied gas flow
simulation. The tool is named `dsmc-runner`. Another tool,
`dsmc-caster` is used to render CSG bodies to check if the body
geometry is defined correctly.

Both programs can be run with `-?` flag to obtain usage informaiton
and help of command-line flags.

To run programs using multiple threads, specify `+RTS -N` flag.

Extra data files which are installed with this package can be found in
`share` directory used by Cabal.

* dsmc-runner

To perform a simulation, input parameters for DSMC must be defined in
«problem file», which uses INI-like format, see `example.prb` included
in the package.

To define the body (which is then referenced from the problem file),
`.geo` format is used, see `body.geo`, `smiley.geo` and `reentry2.geo`
for example.

The runner dumps macroscopic data in text format to the file specified
using `-m` option, which can be then analyzed using visualization
software like ParaView.

To sum up,

    $ dsmc-runner example.prb -m macro.txt +RTS -N

* dsmc-caster
  
dsmc-caster is a program used to view bodies defined using `.geo`
format.

    $ dsmc-caster smiley.geo +RTS -N

Drag with left mouse button to rotate the object and mouse wheel to
zoom in/out. More command-line options are available, see usage help
with `-?` flag.
